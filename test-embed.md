# Embed Feature Implementation

## Summary
I've successfully added the `/embed` feature to your Cloudflare Worker. Here's what was implemented:

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `src/worker.ts`
- Added detection for `/embed` requests using `url.pathname === '/embed'`
- Updated the route handling to accept both `/` and `/embed` paths
- Created a separate HTML template for embed requests that:
  - Removes the header (`#header-bar`)
  - Removes the footer (`#footer-bar`) 
  - Removes the background pattern (`background-image: none`)
  - Sets transparent background (`background-color: transparent`)
  - Reduces padding for a cleaner embed appearance

### 2. Embed-specific styling
The embed version includes inline CSS that overrides the main styles:
```css
body {
  background-image: none !important;
  background-color: transparent !important;
}
#header-bar, #footer-bar {
  display: none !important;
}
#content-area {
  padding: 1em !important;
}
.thought-container {
  margin: 1em 0 !important;
}
```

## How it works
- Normal requests to `/` return the full page with header, footer, and background
- Requests to `/embed` return the same content but with a stripped-down layout
- Both versions use the same caching mechanism but with separate cache keys
- The embed version still includes the theme.js for functionality but hides UI elements

## Usage
Once deployed, you can:
- View the normal page at: `https://your-domain.com/`
- View the embed version at: `https://your-domain.com/embed`

The embed version is perfect for embedding in iframes or other contexts where you want just the content without the site chrome.

## Testing
Due to Windows-specific wrangler issues, I couldn't run the dev server locally, but the code changes are complete and ready for deployment. You can test by deploying with `wrangler deploy` or by running the dev server on a different system.
